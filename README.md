# Laraeasy
Start a laravel project the easiest way possible
***

### **Note:**

**I am not a shell expert and I did this in order to make my daily job easier. Any improvement or suggestion please feel free to PR.**

## Description

This project will help you create a new directory and install laravel for your new project.

## Features

* Create the header and footer files inside a new 'includes' directory (Bootstrap and JQuery included).
* Add Laravel Authentication.
* Create new blades from the start.
* Add the content of the new blades pasting them to the terminal. ** ***

***
** If you chose to add header and footer the new blades will have the
`@includes('blade')`
and you will only have to add the html beetween the header and footer, if header and footer where not added then you can add the complete html file.

***The pasted string mustn't have an empty line break ( this could be done better :/ ).
***

## Requirements

* PHP 5.6
* OSX El Capitan (I have only tested in my computer)

## Installation

1. Download and Run `./install` on your terminal (laraeasy will be installed to `/usr/local/bin`).

## Instructions

1. Run `laraeasy [project_name]` from any directory you want to start your new project.
2. Follow the steps answering with '1' or '2' ( this could also bee done better :/ )
 
## Info

I'll leave the **.sh** files so anyone can modify and adapt it for their convenience.
